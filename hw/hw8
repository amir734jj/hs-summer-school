# HW assigned on 7/27

1) implement K-means and Karatsuba in python
2) given that
  - CPUs are optimized for integer calculation
  - GPUs are optimized for floating point calculations
 > which algorithm is suitable for CPU or GPU
3) think which part of the algorithm can be parallelized
 > by parallelizing we mean which part of can be done independently 
4) write a promise in JavaScript that after 5 seconds prints a "hello world"

Bonus question:
- watch this video and write a paragraph summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvZLI7Db8E
  > what does Promise.reoslve(...) mean
  > what does Promise.all([...]) mean 

## Deliverables by 5pm on Monday 7/30:
    - #1 python implementation of K-means and Karatsuba
    - #2 simple promise in javascript
    * Bonus question if you choose to do it
